## Credit Risk Analysis Report

# Overview of the analysis:
**Purpose**: evaluating of a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.
**Results**: based on the givin dataset and using the logisticregression model.here is the list of the result
* Accuracy score: the ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total number of observation. the result for the given dataset is 99%(0.99)
* Precision score:it the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations. the result for the givin dataset is 100% or (1)
*  Recall: the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted observation.the result for the given dataset is 100% or (1)
**Summary**: the result from the machine learning model;the classification is to be considered as accurate and precise.the result from the confusion matrix the aggregate sums of the column and row are all the same.n=19384.
* classification report:the classification model report; that the model predicted 100 of the health loan or '0' on both precision and recall.and also predicted the high risk loan or '1' 87% of precision and 95% of the recall .
  the room for the error is very small having the accuracy of over 99% and 100% of precision and  recall.very small room for the false negetive and false positive.
 
** i conclude and suggest that the company can use this classfication model to identify the creditworthiness of the borrowers.
